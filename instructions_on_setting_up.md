This is a branch of Kalculator but I just decided to make it a repo for random purposes.
# About
You enter your original price, your discount and it gives you the total, Not hard, The formula is subtracting the original price (k) by the discount (j).
# Steps
Ok, there's some steps...So uh, yeah.
## First of all..
When you extract the archive, immediately go to the .exe's properties (Right click and then Properties, or click it once then Alt + Enter)
Go to the Shortcuts tab and rename the shortcut to this -
**C:\Users\<YOURUSERNAME>\Downloads\kCounter**
Then click OK.
Extra step: make it a shortcut if it isn't.

### How do I find out my username? (Stupid question, but still.)
Go to File Explorer, click This PC, My Computer or whatever, then C:\ , Go to Users and find your main folder. It's a stupid question, but I'm including this.
